# Class: ArcShape

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts:36](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts#L36)

Annular sector centred at `(spec.x, spec.y)` between two radii
(`innerR`, `outerR`) and two angles (`startAngle`, `endAngle`). Angles are
in radians with the standard screen convention — `0` points along `+x`
(3 o'clock) and increasing values sweep clockwise on screen (because the
canvas y-axis grows downward). For a d3-style sunburst projection, subtract
`π/2` from d3's `x0`/`x1` to align "0 = 12 o'clock" with this convention.

Degenerate shapes:
- `innerR === 0` → pie slice (no inner cut-out).
- `endAngle - startAngle >= 2π` and `innerR > 0` → full annulus (ring).
- `endAngle - startAngle >= 2π` and `innerR === 0` → full disk; prefer
  `CircleShape` for that case unless you need the arc spec for animation.

The silhouette is traced with Pixi's native `arc()` for smoothness; bounds,
containment, and dashed-stroke fall back to a discretised polyline sampled
at `ARC_SAMPLE_STEP`.

## Methods

### boundaryIntersect()

> **boundaryIntersect**(`localFromCenter`): [`Point`](../interfaces/Point.md)

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts:130](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts#L130)

Default boundary intersection: ray from the shape's geometric centre
`(0, 0)` toward `localFromCenter`, intersected with a centred AABB
derived from `this.bounds()`. Correct for `RectShape` (anchored
top-left) and any shape whose silhouette can be approximated by its
bounding box.

Geometric shapes with non-rectangular silhouettes (`CircleShape`,
`EllipseShape`, `PolygonShape`) should override this for pixel-accurate
perimeter snapping. Input and output are both centre-relative.

#### Parameters

##### localFromCenter

[`Point`](../interfaces/Point.md)

#### Returns

[`Point`](../interfaces/Point.md)

#### Inherited from

[`ShapeBase`](ShapeBase.md).[`boundaryIntersect`](ShapeBase.md#boundaryintersect)

### bounds()

> **bounds**(): [`Rect`](../interfaces/Rect.md)

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts:72](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts#L72)

Local-space axis-aligned bounding box for hit-testing & decorations.

#### Returns

[`Rect`](../interfaces/Rect.md)

#### Overrides

[`ShapeBase`](ShapeBase.md).[`bounds`](ShapeBase.md#bounds)

***

### contains()

> **contains**(`localX`, `localY`): `boolean`

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts:91](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts#L91)

#### Parameters

### destroy()

> **destroy**(): `void`

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts:141](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts#L141)

### draw()

> **draw**(`spec`): `void`

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts:104](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts#L104)

(Re)paint the shape from the current spec. Called on add and on update.

#### Parameters

##### spec

[`ArcSpec`](../interfaces/ArcSpec.md)

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[`ShapeBase`](ShapeBase.md).[`draw`](ShapeBase.md#draw)

### drawGeometry()

> `protected` **drawGeometry**(`g`, `spec`, `style?`): `void`

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts:44](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts#L44)

Trace the silhouette into `g`, then apply fill + stroke. When `style`
is supplied, it overrides the spec's fill/stroke (decoration use).

#### Parameters

##### g

`Graphics`

##### spec

[`ArcSpec`](../interfaces/ArcSpec.md)

##### style?

[`ShapePaintStyle`](../interfaces/ShapePaintStyle.md)

#### Returns

`void`

#### Overrides

[`ShapeBase`](ShapeBase.md).[`drawGeometry`](ShapeBase.md#drawgeometry)

### getHitArea()

> **getHitArea**(): `IHitArea`

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts:85](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts#L85)

Hit-test region for this shape, derived from [drawGeometry](#drawgeometry).

Default behaviour: the returned `IHitArea`'s `contains(x, y)` delegates
to `bodyGfx.containsPoint({ x, y })`. Because `drawGeometry` is the
single function that paints the silhouette into `bodyGfx` (see
[draw](#draw)), the hit region tracks the rendered silhouette exactly —
including any stroke (Pixi's `containsPoint` uses `strokeContains` for
stroke instructions, with a half-stroke-width tolerance).

The returned object is stable across `draw()` calls: the closure reads
`bodyGfx` by reference, so subsequent `drawGeometry` repaints
automatically update the hit region. No re-wiring of `gfx.hitArea`.

Subclasses with cheap analytical hit tests — `CircleShape`
(`x² + y² ≤ r²`), `RectShape` (AABB) — may override to skip Pixi's
path-walk on hot paths. Keep the contract: input is shape-local
coordinates; `true` iff the point is inside the silhouette.

#### Returns

`IHitArea`

#### Inherited from

[`ShapeBase`](ShapeBase.md).[`getHitArea`](ShapeBase.md#gethitarea)

***

### paintInto()

> **paintInto**(`g`, `style?`): `void`

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts:115](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/base/ShapeBase.ts#L115)

Decoration entry point — repaint the silhouette into someone else's
`Graphics` with a style override. The shape uses its own current spec;
decorations don't pass one. (Distinct from `ShapeCtor.paintInto` —
the static method markers use, which takes an explicit spec + anchor.)

Optional for back-compat: `TextShape` (and similar non-silhouette shapes)
may omit it. Decorations check for presence before calling and silently
skip when absent (text labels just won't have glow / halo applied).
Every shape that extends `ShapeBase` has it for free.

#### Parameters

##### g

`Graphics`

##### style?

[`ShapePaintStyle`](../interfaces/ShapePaintStyle.md)

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[`ShapeBase`](ShapeBase.md).[`paintInto`](ShapeBase.md#paintinto)

### visualCenter()

> **visualCenter**(): [`Point`](../interfaces/Point.md)

Defined in: [canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts:82](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/primitives/shapes/ArcShape.ts#L82)

Visual centre of an annular sector — half-angle direction, midradius
distance. Used by inset-content labels (`placement: 'center'`); good
enough for visual centring without the (more expensive) area-weighted
centroid integral.

#### Returns

[`Point`](../interfaces/Point.md)

#### Overrides

[`ShapeBase`](ShapeBase.md).[`visualCenter`](ShapeBase.md#visualcenter)
