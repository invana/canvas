Defined in: [canvas/src/layouts/Layout.ts:50](https://github.com/invana/canvas/blob/9082d7c9f5a0b14b8c8220f666d8bd3c74c1d3bd/packages/canvas/src/layouts/Layout.ts#L50)

Why the run ended.

 - `completed` — the layout settled / finished on its own.
 - `stopped`   — `stop()` (or a second `apply()`) cancelled it.
